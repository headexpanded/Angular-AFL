A simple Aussie Rules AFL ladder, without the gambling ads: [here it is on-line.](https://angular-afl.web.app/)



The official AFL ladder is drenched in advertising and loads slowly.

So this ladder has no ads, and loads quickly. That'll show 'em.

Click on any team for more info about their season.
- Data comes from the API at [Squiggle](https://squiggle.com.au/)

- I used [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.3.
